# Loan Approver

Loans are the core business of loan companies. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties. This process can be eased if the company can get insight upon the applicant using his past details.

The core idea of this project is to build a web app which uses a predictive model to predict if an applicant will be able to repay the lending company or not, so that the company can decide whether to approve the loan or not. The predictions are based on a machine learning model built using Azure Machine Learning Studio and the web app is hosted using the Azure App Service.
